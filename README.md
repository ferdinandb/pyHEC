# pyHEC

**pyHEC** is a Python package that facilitates the use of the university's high-end computing (HEC) cluster. It provides higher-level tools to easily parallelize code execution on both a local computer and a multi-node computing cluster. The tool aims to compile the functionality of popular Python packages to accomplish common tasks without requiring a deep understanding of all the technical aspects of high-performance computing (HPC).

pyHEC is optimized for Lancaster University's HEC cluster. Please refer to the [ISS help page](https://answers.lancaster.ac.uk/display/ISS/High+End+Computing+(HEC)+help) to find out more about the cluster.
